ORB\_SLAM2 is an open source complete SLAM system and a more improved version of ORB\_SLAM. The improved system provides the usage of different cameras like monocular, stereo, and RGB-D. On top of that, ORB\_SLAM2 includes loop closing, map reusing, relocalization, and local Bundle Adjustment (BA) capability which is previously not available in ORB\_SLAM \cite{journals/corr/Mur-ArtalMT15,mur2017orb}. ORB\_SLAM2 have also been used on popular publicly available datasets and have been proven to be in most of these cases to have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy through their methods. In their research paper, they discussed about their implementation on SLAM, and they did a comprehensive analysis of the datasets for example in the KITTI Dataset, they have used a range of metrics like the absolute translation RMSE $t\textsubscript{abs}$ in \cite{sturm2012benchmark}, and the average relative translation $t\textsubscript{rel}$ and rotation $r\textsubscript{rel}$ errors proposed in \cite{geiger2013vision}.

ORB\_SLAM2 has also been used as the benchmark for comparision for different implementation of featured-SLAM \cite{mur2017visual,paul2017comparative,pire2017s}. In these papers, they discussed about their implementation, the differences and did comparision to the same publicly known datasets. As such, I believe that majority of these researchers would benefit if there is a tool for them to generate their own dataset and test their implementation with ease instead of relying on the same known dataset.
