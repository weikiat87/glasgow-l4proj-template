Another factor that will affect the evaluation of a researchers' proposed solution would be how real world dataset groundtuth is being captured. As mention in section \ref{c:literaturereview:tumdata} the way TUM captured their groundtruth data was by using a high-accuracy motion-caption system with eight high-speed tracking camera which was why their dataset was accurate. However, other researchers who are using drones or robots might be using a lightweight and low cost GPS which could affect the accuracy of the trajectory. In a simulated however, these variables would be controlled by framework and the researchers could also choose introduce jitters to simulate a drone movement.
