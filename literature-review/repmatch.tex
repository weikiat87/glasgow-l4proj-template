RepMatch on the other hand is built upon Bilateral Functions(BF)\cite{lin2014bilateral} and uses Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) \cite{fischler1987random} for outliers rejection when they are identifying features in implemention of SfM. RepMatch however use strecha dataset, which laser scans(LIDAR) real life scenery and uses series of mathamatical equations to estimate the ground truth and camera calibration (see \cite{strecha2008benchmarking} for detail explaination of strecha dataset).
