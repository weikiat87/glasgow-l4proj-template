In visual SLAM, moving objects can be issue as most of SLAM would try to differentiate moving objects and the robot or between stationary objects and moving objects. In most cases, SLAM and moving object tracking would be isolated and tacking moving object in SLAM by itself is already a huge topic and have been studied extensively by researchers over the years. In an open dynamic environment, researcher may try to isolate the environment however it could be a time and resource consuming process. In an simulated environment, we could completely avoid such an occurrance at a minimum cost.
