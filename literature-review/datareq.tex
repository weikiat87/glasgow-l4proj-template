ORB\_SLAM2 use a couple of publicly known real world datasets that is avaiable on the web. One of the dataset that they use was the TUM dataset. TUM dataset is a large collection of RGB images with groundtruth data aimed to be used for visual SLAM system \cite{sturm12iros}. Their color and depth images was collected using a Microsoft Kinect and the ground truth trajectory was collected using a high-accuracy motion-caption system with eight high-speed tracking camera. The color image resolution is 640x480 pixels in PNG format and the tracjectory text file contains the translation and rotation of the object in each frame per line\cite{sturm12iros}. 

In our study, we created our dataset to match the TUM dataset file and folder structure with the exception of the color image size (in our case would be 1280x720). We match our format to the format TUM dataset in order to run our own sequence of images on ORB\_SLAM2.
