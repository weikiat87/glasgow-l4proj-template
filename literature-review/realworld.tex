Real world data is vital for researchers as these data would help validate the researchers proposed solution for a complex problem. In Computer Vision, real world data is collected using drones or robots moving along a specific path. However, many factors like the the path terrain, geometry of the location, camera settings or even parts of the drone could have affected the dataset without the knownledge of the researcher. Thomas argued that if a robot position is known perfectly, building an enviroment map with the preceived data is a minor issue \cite{lemaire2007vision}. As such, in a simulated enviroment, the position will be known perfectly as there are no real world interference that could occur as we can control the tracjectory and control how the generated dataset from the simulated environment be like.
