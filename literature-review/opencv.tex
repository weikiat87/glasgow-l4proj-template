OpenCV is an open source computer vision library that is designed to have a strong focus on computational efficiency for real world application \cite{bradski2008learning}. It is also used in most SfM algorith and in the algorithm that we have looked into, ORB\_SLAM2, it is used as an efficient way to read sequences of images and mapped using Features from Accelerated Segment Test(FAST) for feature detection and Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features(BRIEF) for binary descriptor extractor to produce Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)\cite{rublee2011orb,murTRO2015}.

Another important functionality that OpenCV provides that most SfM algorithm uses would be the ability to calibrate the camera based on a sequence of images or video. This feature allows algorithm that uses OpenCV to make adjustment to the images as each camera have some form of distortion and each camera distortion is different from each other. In our study, we will be using OpenCV to calibrate the camera used for real world data, and extracting the video frames as sequence. For our simulated data, we would do the calculation (see section ).
