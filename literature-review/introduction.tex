In this section, I have found different variance of Featured-based detectors for SfM; namely ORB\_SLAM2 and RepMatch. These research papers discusses about how their version of SfM is implemented and most featured-based detectors would be based and be compared to ORB\_SLAM2. However, little details about how their test data was collected and majority of their paper would use publicily available dataset like the Technical University of Munich (TUM) Visual Odometry dataset \cite{sturm12iros}. 

As for research papers pertaining to the applicability of detectors, they mainly talk about the use case scenario and the benefits of using detectors. As such, by studying these research papers, it would help me identify what sort of data is needed for Feature-Based SfM and what sort of potential real world effects like dynamic environment and difficulty of capturing ground truth (See Section \ref{c:literaturereview:variables}) that could have been in the real world data that was collected.
