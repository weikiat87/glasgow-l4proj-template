Given that more research have been done on Feature-based detectors for SfM(See Section \ref{c:literaturereview:orbslam2}). Focusing on creating an application for Feature-based detectors would help out researchers who currently working on it and would help see how well previously made Feature-based detectors stand against test data from a simulated environment. Moreover, this paper will not be looking at how Feature-based detectors is implemented, but the data required for Feature-based detectors to work.

As such, this paper will be focusing on created an application for generating simulated data for Feature-based detectors and comparing real world data in comparision with the generated simulated data.
