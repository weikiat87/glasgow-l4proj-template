\begin{itemize} 
	\item Create an application that simulates a drone would collect images and data that can be used for Feature-Based Detectors; ORB\_SLAM2.
	\item Determine the effectiveness of simulated data with real-world data on ORB\_SLAM2.
	\item Suggest other practical ways of using simulation environment for other vision and machine learning algorithm.
