Present research about SfM has always been about trying to solve the computational issues about SfM such as loop closure, feature representation and data associations \cite{durrant2006simultaneous}. There also many different implementations of SfM that try to address these issues. However there is a lack of research on how much real world changes can make a significant impact on the performance of SfM.

With the exception of Microsoft AirSim (See Section \ref{c:literaturereview:application:airsim}), there is no readily made available tools for researchers to generate test data that they could use and researchers would most likely take datasets that are made avaiable publicily. 

This study aims to identify and create a framework for researchers to test their implementation of featured-SFM in an controlled environment and compare the controlled results with real world data results.
